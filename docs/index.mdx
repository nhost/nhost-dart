## Getting Started

First install the package

```yaml
dependencies:
  nhost_dart: ^1.0.2
```

Then, import the package and create new NhostClient

```dart
import 'package:nhost_dart/nhost_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  final nhost = NhostClient(
    subdomain: Subdomain(
        region: 'eu-central-1',
        subdomain: 'backend-5e69d1d7',
      ),
    );


    // for self host or local host you may use ServiceUrls
    /*
    final nhost = NhostClient(
      serviceUrls: ServiceUrls(
        authUrl: '',
        storageUrl: '',
        functionsUrl: '',
        graphqlUrl: '',
      ),
    );
    */

  // User registration
  await nhost.auth.register(email: 'new-user@gmail.com', password: 'xxxxx');

  // Upload a file
  final currentUser = nhost.auth.currentUser;
  await nhost.storage.uploadBytes(
    filePath: '/users/${currentUser.id}/image.jpg',
    bytes: [/* ... */],
    contentType: 'image/jpeg',
  ),

  // Log out
  await nhost.auth.logout();
}
```

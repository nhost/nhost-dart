# This is a template that is used to produce package-specific workflows
#
# The reason we want package-specific workflows at all is so we can
#
# 1. Limit the workflow to only being triggered on changes to files on the
#    package's path, and that of its dependents
# 2. Display a package-specific testing badge (at the time of writing, you can't
#    request badges for matrix configurations)
#
# Instantiations of this template are produced by the Melos postbootstrap script
# which can be found in `melos.yaml`.
